# Log files (optional - you might want to track an empty one or a sample)
# If you don't want to track the log file at all:
traceability_log.csv

# Data files (optional - if your products.csv is small and part of the setup, track it)
# If your label_images become very large, you might ignore them,
# but for a few small samples, it's okay to track.
